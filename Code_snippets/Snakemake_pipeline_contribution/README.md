# README

This folder contains some code snippets that I have created for filtering of VCF genomic data. These code snippets will be used for a variant allele frequency and effect analysis that I will be performing using a Snakemake genomics pipeline constructed by Graeme R. Ford. This pipeline is available at: https://github.com/Tuks-ICMM/Pharmacogenetic-Analysis-Pipeline. 

My contributions to the code are clearly demarcated.
